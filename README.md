# DRUPAL TEST

This repository uses a docker-compose file which sets up a Drupal 10 container + a Mysql container.

The docker-compose file uses multiples mount-binds between the containers and the host.

The custom module provides a controller for the homepage, which shows a listing of articles displayed
with the article's view mode "teaser". There is a custom twig template in
'web/themes/custom/themetest/templates/themetest/page--articles--all.html.twig' which adds a wrapper
div which is used for styling in 'sass/styles.scss'

The custom theme is based in Olivero, generated with the [starterkit theming tool](https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-themes/starterkit-theme)

```
php web/core/scripts/drupal generate-theme themetest --name 'Theme de test' --description "Custom theme generated from Olivero" --starterkit olivero --path=themes/custom
```

The theme uses SASS. For compiling the SCSS files, please use:

```
$> cd themes/custom/themetest
$> compass compile --force (or compass watch)
```

# RUNNING THE TEST

```
$> docker-composer up -d

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/
```

Note that the site might not work until the database 'test.sql' is fully imported
on the MySQL container, so please wait a few seconds or retry if you receive an
error.

# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT 

My local dev is quite weird because I can not install docker on windows, so I have to launch a ssh tunnel to connect my vscode
to the docker "app" instance which holds all the project:

```
(on vagrant box) $> ssh -L 192.168.0.13:2323:localhost:22 docker
(on my windows vscode) $> ssh docker
```

There is this .ssh/config file on my windows host to facilitate vscode ssh setup:

```
WW930+a805442@DESKTOP-1DCHHE2 /cygdrive/c/Users/a805442 $ cat .ssh/config
HostName localhost User vagrant Port 2222 Host docker
  HostName 192.168.0.13
  User root
  Port 2323
```

Ã nd this is the vagrant box .ssh/config:

```
vagrant@homestead:~$ cat .ssh/config
Host docker
  HostName localhost
  User root
  Port 2222

```

My vagrant box has the port 2323 opened, besides the normal vagrant ssh port 2222.
